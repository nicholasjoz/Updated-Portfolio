There weren't screenshots/directions specifically having us use certain stylistic elements, so I just made sure to get the 3 'requirements' down - the navbar being sticky and mobile responsiveness (both content and images) which is included.'  -->

I am a diehard Bills fan, and when your first memories of sports involve your team making the Super Bowl FOUR years in a row, (and losing each one), you get two feelings: <br> <br></p>
                      <p>
                      1. Hey, sports can be cruel sometimes <br>
                      2. At least we make it to the Super Bowl every year, so we'll get them next time! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I could not have been more wrong about #2. <br>
                      As the Bills entered the longest postseason drought of any major sports franchise, I graduated high school, graduated from Vassar College with honors (majoring in Film and Economics), moved to California, completed a Masters program in Finance at UC Santa Cruz, and moved to SF to begin work at Google in 2010. Then finally in 2017, after seven years at Google (five as Project Manager on the Youtube Team), the Bills finally made the playoffs- for the first time since the 90's - under the leadership of QB Tyrod Taylor. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <br> As expected, they promptly lost that game, and Nick entered the Berkeley Full Stack Developer Bootcamp to become a more effective Project/Product/Program Manager. </p>
